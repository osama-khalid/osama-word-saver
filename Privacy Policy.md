**Privacy Policy for Osama's Word Saver Chrome Extension**

**Effective Date: October 17, 2025**

This document outlines the privacy practices of the Osama's Word Saver Chrome Extension ("the Extension") in a comprehensive prose format. We are committed to protecting your privacy by ensuring minimal data collection and secure handling, with a primary focus on local storage.

**1. The Extension's Purpose and Data Handling Philosophy**
The sole and singular purpose of the Osama's Word Saver Extension is to function as a Language Learning and Vocabulary Building Tool. It is designed to assist users in acquiring new vocabulary by allowing them to instantly translate and save selected words from any foreign webpage into a personal, reviewable list. Our philosophy is rooted in data minimization; we only handle the data absolutely necessary to deliver this service.

**2. Data Collection and Usage**
The Extension does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, address, email address, or financial details. All data handling is done in service of the Extension's core function, falling under the categories described below:
Website Content: The Extension collects the specific word or phrase that a user highlights and chooses to translate. This content is necessary to be transmitted to the translation service and subsequently saved for the user's personal vocabulary list.
User Activity: The Extension tracks word usage statistics (such as total lookups and word counts) and the source language code of the words saved. This activity data is used exclusively to populate the statistical charts and language frequency breakdown in the Extension's popup, thereby assisting the user in tracking their personal learning progress.
Web History (URL): When a word is saved, the Extension notes the URL of the webpage where the saving action was triggered. This information is stored so the user can review the context in which the word was encountered, which is a key educational feature.

**3. Data Storage and Security**
All vocabulary lists, usage statistics, and associated contextual data (URL, source language) are stored exclusively on the user's local device using the secure Chrome storage.local API.
No Developer Access: This locally stored data is never transmitted to the developer (Osama) or any external servers for collection, profiling, or monetization.
Security: Data that is transmitted to the third-party API (as detailed below) is always done so over a secure connection (HTTPS), ensuring that the information is encrypted during transit.

**4. Third-Party Data Sharing**
To function, the Extension relies on one external service:
Google Translate API: The Extension utilizes the Google Translate API (via https://translate.googleapis.com/*) to perform the language translations. Only the selected word or phrase and the detected source language code are transmitted to this secure endpoint. This sharing is essential and solely for the purpose of receiving the accurate English translation for the user. We do not control Google's handling of this transaction data, but we strictly adhere to the policy of minimizing the shared input data.

**5. User Data Control and Deletion Rights**
Users maintain complete sovereignty over their data:
Review and Access: All collected data (words, translations, and stats) can be fully reviewed, filtered, and managed within the Extension's popup interface.
Export: Users are provided with a dedicated feature to export their entire locally stored vocabulary list as a CSV file for backup or use in other applications, utilizing the downloads permission for this user-requested action.
Deletion: Users have the ability to delete individual words or clear their entire vocabulary list at any time via the Extension's controls. Uninstalling the Extension will also automatically erase all locally stored data.

**6. Policy Changes and Contact**
This Privacy Policy may be updated to comply with new regulations or to reflect changes in the Extension's functionality. We commit to updating the "Effective Date" whenever substantive changes are made. Continued use of the Extension constitutes acceptance of the current policy.
